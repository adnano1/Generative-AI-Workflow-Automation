# Generative AI Workflow Automation

## Project Overview
The **Generative AI Workflow Automation** is an end-to-end application leveraging LangChain and Hugging Face to build a generative AI-powered assistant. This project demonstrates how to integrate powerful natural language processing and contextual task chaining to automate workflows and enhance productivity in various domains such as healthcare, finance, and education.

---

## Features
- **Conversational Workflow Guidance:** Uses LangChain to provide contextual assistance in setting up workflows through natural language.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Employs Hugging Face models for data extraction, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- **Task Chaining:** Leverages LangChain’s task orchestration to manage multi-step workflows seamlessly.
- **Generative Outputs:** Produces intelligent insights or reports based on user input and workflow execution.

---

## Tech Stack
1. **LangChain**: For context-aware task chaining and orchestration.
2. **Hugging Face**: For state-of-the-art NLP models and generative AI capabilities.
3. **Python**: Primary programming language.
4. **Flask/FastAPI** (Optional): For building the API/backend.
5. **Streamlit** (Optional): For creating a user-friendly interface.
6. **Docker**: For containerization and deployment.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Hugging Face API Key

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/generative-ai-workflow-automation.git
   cd generative-ai-workflow-automation
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
   ```

5. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the Application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` or `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage
1. **Input Data:** Provide raw data or a query through the user interface.
2. **Workflow Selection:** Choose from predefined workflows or create a custom one.
3. **Execution:** The assistant processes the input using LangChain and Hugging Face.
4. **Results:** View generated outputs such as insights, summaries, or reports.
